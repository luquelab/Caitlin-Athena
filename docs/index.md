**People.** Welcome to the documentation of Caitlin Bartels' project Github repository! My name is Caitlin Bartels, and I am an undergraduate student studying Biology at San Diego State University ([SDSU](https://www.sdsu.edu)), with plans to attend medical school to become a Neurologist. If you have any questions, please email me at [cbartels7466@sdsu.edu].

**What.** This project is a template for projects in my [lab](https://www.luquelab.com).

**Why.** Research projects usually get shaped to be published in articles. This project template is part of an initiative to make research more accessible to the general and specialized public, from the beginning of a project.

**How.** The documentation is generated using Jekyll and GitHub Pages from the docs/ folder in the GitHub repo associated with the project. The updates in the documentation are reflected in the repository.

**What else?** Use the side panel to learn more about the current project's [Synthesis](https://luquelab.github.io/project_template/synthesis/), [Background](https://luquelab.github.io/project_template/background/), [Approach](https://luquelab.github.io/project_template/approach/) [Outputs](https://luquelab.github.io/project_template/output/), and [Impact](https://luquelab.github.io/project_template/impact/).
